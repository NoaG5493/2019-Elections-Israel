Data analysis of Israel Elections in 2019.

In the attched file "Trasformation matrixs September vs April" you can see my data analysis code, describing the transformations in votes between the two elections heppend in Israel on 2019, the first in september and second in April.
In order to build this report I used statistical methods to calculate transfomations between data frames, some by math  and other by exciting library like NNLS.
The report shows some heatmaps describing the movements of votes between the diffarent parties during these elections. 

In the attached file "Socioeconomical voting" you can see the distibutions of votes per party and per socio economical level in these elections.
